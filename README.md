# What to see while in Westford
Help us with ideas for trips:)

As we are in US for couple more weeks, we would like to collect some ideas where to go and what to see. We need some ideas for all-weekend trips but also for something close to Westford which we can use to fill the time gaps and maybe some weekday afternoons/evenings.

I've added places we've already visited or plan to visit, so please give me more!
